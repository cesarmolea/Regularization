# Course: Machine Learning for All
## Topic for Session 5: “Model Selection and Regularization”
(César Montiel-Olea)

In this session, you will be introduced to variable-selection models for regression problems. We will learn algorithms that will allow us to choose the important variables when we want to predict an outcome variable using linear regression. We will also learn regularization methods, such as Ridge and LASSO, that are suitable to fit least-square methods when we have many predictors.  We will make use of the leaps and glmnet packages in R.
